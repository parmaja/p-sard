Pascal SARD script
==================

The idea behind it, it is not use any of reserved words it is kind of challenge, only signs (symbols), only objects there is no "void", "var", "let" "function" or "procedure" or even "if", "else" or "while".
But we can implement "if" or "while" internally by define it as internal object (not yet).
